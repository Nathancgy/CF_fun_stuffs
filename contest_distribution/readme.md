- `filter_data.py`: Parses the input file, filters for Division 1/2 contests, and extracts relevant information.
- `extract_parti.py`: Extracts participant data from the input file.
- `data_preprocess.py`: Preprocesses the data to prepare for analysis.
- `count_parti.py`: Counts the number of participants in each contest.
- `plot.py`: Plots the number of participants over time.
- `bar_chart.py`: Creates a bar chart of the number of rated contests over time.
